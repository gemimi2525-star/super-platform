# SYNAPSE Platform Launch

Today marks a significant milestone in our journey toward radical transparency and accountable governance.

## What's New

The SYNAPSE Trust Center is now live, providing:

- **Public Proof Verification**: Verify any governance action independently
- **Complete Audit Trails**: Every decision is recorded and signed
- **Open Governance Framework**: Our policies are versioned and public
- **Support Portal**: Direct channel for questions and escalations

## Why This Matters

Traditional platforms operate as black boxes. Users must trust without verification. SYNAPSE changes this paradigm by making governance transparent, auditable, and verifiable by default.

## Get Started

Visit the [Governance](/en/trust/governance) section to explore our framework, or try the [Proof Verifier](/en/trust/verify) to validate audit trails.
