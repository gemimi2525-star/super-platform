# Trust Center SEO Optimization

We're excited to share how we've enhanced the SYNAPSE Trust Center's discoverability and search engine optimization.

## Dynamic Sitemap Generation

Our new MDX-based CMS automatically generates a sitemap with:
- All published pages and articles
- Proper i18n alternates (en/th)
- Smart priority and change frequency hints
- Published-only content filter

## Metadata Per Page

Every page now includes:
- SEO-optimized titles and descriptions
- OpenGraph tags for social sharing
- Proper hreflang tags for multilingual support

## What's Next

We'll continue monitoring search performance and making improvements based on Search Console data.
