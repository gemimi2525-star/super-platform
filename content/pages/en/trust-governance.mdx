# Governance Framework

SYNAPSE operates on a distributed governance model with multiple layers of oversight and accountability.

## Core Principles

1. **No Single Point of Trust**: Decisions require multi-party approval
2. **Cryptographic Proof**: All actions are signed and verifiable
3. **Immutable Audit Trail**: Records cannot be altered or deleted
4. **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify governance actions

## Governance Layers

### Authority Layer
- Multi-party approval requirements
- Cryptographic signing of all decisions
- Role-based access control

### Policy Engine
- Versioned governance policies
- Automatic enforcement
- Public policy registry

### Audit Ledger
- Immutable record of all actions
- Cryptographic proof generation
- Independent verification support

## How It Works

Every significant action in the platform goes through this flow:

1. **Request**: User or system initiates an action
2. **Policy Check**: Policy engine validates against current rules
3. **ApprovalRequired**: Multi-authority approval if needed
4. **Execution**: Action performed with cryptographic signature
5. **Audit**: Immutable record created
6. **Proof**: Verifiable proof bundle generated

## Accountability

All governance participants are identified and their actions are:
- Cryptographically signed
- Timestamped
- Permanently recorded
- Publicly verifiable
