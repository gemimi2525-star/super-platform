# Trust Through Transparency

Welcome to the SYNAPSE Trust Center. We believe in radical transparency and accountability.

## Our Commitment

Every decision, every approval, and every audit trail is cryptographically signed and permanently recorded. Our governance framework ensures that power is distributed, auditable, and subject to independent verification.

## Key Features

- **Immutable Audit Trails**: All actions are cryptographically signed and stored
- **Multi-Authority Governance**: No single point of trust or failure
- **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify proof bundles independently
- **Policy Version Control**: All governance policies are versioned and auditable
