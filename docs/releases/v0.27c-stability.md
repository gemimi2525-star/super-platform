# Release: v0.27c-stability

> **APICOREDATA Client OS — Stability Release**  
> **Date:** 2026-02-15  
> **Tag:** v0.27c-stability

---

## Highlights

- **Infra Recovery** — API routes survive Firestore quota exhaustion (503 JSON, not 500 HTML)
- **UI Parity** — Organizations modal + About tab match across Legacy (light) and System Hub (dark)
- **About Parity** — System Hub now has "About" tab showing Architecture Stack (NEXUS → ORBIT → SYNAPSE) and Governance status
- **Quota Reduction** — `Cache-Control: private, max-age=30` on high-read routes; client-side 503 backoff guard

## What's Included

| Component | Change | Commit |
|:----------|:-------|:-------|
| Auth Hardening | `getAuthContext()` quota path → null → 401 | `8b25a43` |
| API Cache Headers | users, orgs, audit routes | `8b25a43` |
| OrganizationsPanel | API base fix + dark modal parity | `8b25a43`, `8debabe` |
| UsersPanel | 503 detection + backoff guard | `8b25a43`, this commit |
| Static Endpoints | `/api/ops/about`, `/api/ops/health/orgs` | `8489a7e`, `7b4521e` |
| About View | System Hub dark-themed About tab | `7b4521e` |
| Gate Script | `scripts/post-hotfix-27c.sh` | this commit |

## Known Limitations

1. **Vercel Bot Challenge (429):**  
   Direct `curl` to authenticated routes (`/api/platform/*`) may return 429 from Vercel edge bot protection. This is not a system error.  
   **Workaround:** Use browser `fetch()`, or use the static `/api/ops/*` endpoints which do not trigger bot challenge.

2. **Firestore Quota:**  
   If Firestore daily quota is exhausted, API routes return 503 JSON. UI panels show a user-friendly retry banner. Auth falls back to token-only (no role lookup) to avoid cascading failures.

## Verification

```bash
# Run all parity gates
bash scripts/post-hotfix-27c.sh

# Expected output: "OVERALL: PASS — all gates green"
```

## No-Touch Zones (Preserved)

- ❌ Auth flow / login / middleware routing — unchanged
- ❌ SYNAPSE Governance Kernel — frozen
- ❌ Legacy "About" component — unchanged
- ❌ No new Firestore reads added
